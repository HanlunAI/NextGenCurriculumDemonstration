        "In the beginning, computers were invented with an aim to supplement human thinking methods, more specifically, to help us to think straight through the midst of complexity. In this series of demonstrations, we provide a journey of mathematical knowledge discovery accompanied with the nurturing of computer skills by the way. In practice, the Mathematics part will include some basic counting principles and statistics, and the Computer part will be some pre-written Python codes for high school students. Through this journey, you may develop you own style of exploration via self-experiment, peer learning, web-searching, etc.\n",

Now, in our journey of mathematical knowledge discovery, we meant to be a wayfarer following the paths of our pioneers, bypassing the process of reinventing the wheel. In this journey, we share their joys of getting something done. In the future, some of us here may make some new inventions and push the frontiers of knowledge."
